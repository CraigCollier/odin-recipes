Boil, without stirring, for 5 minutes or until mixture thickens. Stir in lime juice and 1/4 cup rum. </li>
        
        <li>Transfer 1/3 cup rum syrup to a small heatproof bowl. Set aside for 30 minutes to cool. Add 250g of remaining strawberries. Stir to coat. Cover. Refrigerate until required. Set remaining rum syrup aside. </li>
        
        <li>Using an electric mixer, beat 1 cup cream, until just-firm peaks form. Fold in custard. Spoon custard mixture over jelly mixture. Using picture as a guide, arrange jam rolls over custard mixture. Drizzle with remaining rum syrup. Place remaining strawberries over sponge rolls. Cover. Refrigerate for 4 hours. </li>
